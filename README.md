This repository contains Coq-proofs about some basic facts about Chebyshev
polynomials. It started as a branch of the coqrep library and the early 
version history can still be found in the corresponding repository.

An opam file gives the explicit dependency and let you compile the library

```
opam pin add -y -n cheby .
opam install cheby
```

The file CPoly_ex.v contains some examples of what we can do with this library.
